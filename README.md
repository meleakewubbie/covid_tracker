# Washington State Covid Tracker
The following link: https://meleakewubbie.github.io/covid_tracker/ displays an interactive choropleth web map 
* The viewer can see covid counts in Washington State counties per ten thousand people as of December 17th 2021
* Hover over a county to see a counties covid count!
* Based on the map and research I discovered western washington has a higher overall COVID count but middle and eastern washington has a higher COVID count relative to their population
